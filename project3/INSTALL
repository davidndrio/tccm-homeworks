# 1. Ensure that all .f90 files and the input file you want to run are in the same folder. The files are:

	- 0-MAIN_CODE.f90: The main program, handles input/output, initialization, and simulation execution.
	- 1-read_Natoms.f90: Reads the number of atoms from the input file.
	- 2-read_molecule.f90: Reads coordinates and masses of atoms.
	- 3-compute_distances.f90: Calculates distances between atoms.
	- 4-V.f90: Computes potential energy using the Lennard-Jones potential.
	- 5-kinetic_energy.f90: Calculates kinetic energy based on velocities.
	- 6-total_energy.f90: Computes total energy (kinetic + potential).
	- 7-compute_acc.f90: Calculates acceleration based on forces.
	- 8-molecular_dynamics.f90: Contains the main simulation loop.
	- (Input file with the name you want)

# 2. Compile the code with the following statement, in one line (the name of the program is up to you, that's why it is in parentheses):

	gfortran -o (md_simulation) 0-MAIN_CODE.f90 1-read_Natoms.f90 2-read_molecule.f90 3-compute_distances.f90 4-V.f90 5-kinetic_energy.f90 6-total_energy.f90 7-compute_acc.f90 8-molecular_dynamics.f90	

# 3. Run the code with the name you chose for your program file:

	./(md_simulation)

# 4. The prompt will ask you to enter the name of your input file. Do it, including the extension if it has one.

# 5. You will get a file called trajectories.xyz, where you can find the total energy, the kinetic energy, and the potential energy (all in J/mol)
# as for each 10 steps of the trajectory.
