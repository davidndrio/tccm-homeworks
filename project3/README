# Molecular Dynamics Simulation with Lennard-Jones Potential

This project implements a basic molecular dynamics simulation using the Lennard-Jones potential in Fortran90.It uses the velocity Verlet algorithm 
fori the equations of motion over time.


## Overview

- Language: Fortran90
- Purpose: To simulate the dynamics of a small systems, tracking positions, velocities, and energies over time.
- Key Features:
  - Implementation of the Lennard-Jones potential for interatomic interactions.
  - Velocity Verlet algorithm for time integration.
  - Calculation and monitoring of kinetic, potential, and total energy.

### Directory Structure

- 0-MAIN_CODE.f90: The main program, handles input/output, initialization, and simulation execution.
- 1-read_Natoms.f90: Reads the number of atoms from the input file, which must be the number in the first line.
- 2-read_molecule.f90: Reads coordinates and masses of atoms.
- 3-compute_distances.f90: Calculates distances between atoms.
- 4-V.f90: Computes potential energy using the Lennard-Jones potential.
- 5-kinetic_energy.f90: Calculates kinetic energy based on velocities.
- 6-total_energy.f90: Computes total energy (kinetic + potential).
- 7-compute_acc.f90: Calculates acceleration based on forces.
- 8-molecular_dynamics.f90: Contains the main simulation loop.
- (Input file with the name you want): The input file should contain:

	- The first line indicates the number of atoms (Natoms).
	- Each subsequent line lists the x, y, z coordinates followed by the mass in grams per mole for each atom:
