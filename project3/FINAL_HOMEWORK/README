# Molecular Dynamics Simulation with Lennard-Jones Potential

	This project implements a basic molecular dynamics simulation using the Lennard-Jones potential in Fortran90.
	It uses the velocity Verlet algorithm for the equations of motion over time.

## Overview

	- Language: Fortran90
	- Purpose: To simulate the dynamics of a small system, tracking positions, velocities, and energies over time.
	- Key Features:
  		- Implementation of the Lennard-Jones potential for interatomic interactions.
  		- Velocity Verlet algorithm for time integration.
  		- Calculation and monitoring of kinetic, potential, and total energy.

### Directory Structure

	- 0-MAIN_CODE.f90: The main program, handles input/output, initialization, and simulation execution.
	- 1-read_Natoms.f90: Reads the number of atoms from the input file, which must be the number in the first line.
	- 2-read_molecule.f90: Reads coordinates and masses of atoms.
	- 3-compute_distances.f90: Calculates distances between atoms.
	- 4-V.f90: Computes potential energy using the Lennard-Jones potential.
	- 5-kinetic_energy.f90: Calculates kinetic energy based on velocities.
	- 6-total_energy.f90: Computes total energy (kinetic + potential).
	- 7-compute_acc.f90: Calculates acceleration based on forces.
	- 8-mass2symbol.f90: Converts atomic masses read on input to the corresponding chemical symbol.
	- 9-molecular_dynamics.f90: Contains the main simulation loop.
	- (Input file with the name you want). The input file must have the following format:

	- The first line indicates the number of atoms (Natoms).
	- Each subsequent line lists the x, y, z coordinates in nm of each atom, followed by the mass of the corresponding atom in grams per mole.

#### Output Format

	The output, trajectories.xyz, has the following structure. For each step, it prints:
	
		-A line containing the number of atoms in the simulation
		-A line with the kinetic energy (KE), potential energy (PE) and total energy (TE) (in J/mol) for that step, the step number and the total simulation time.
		-Several lines containing, each one, the atomic symbol of one of the atoms in the simulation, followed by its x,y,z coordinates for that step.
