# FOLLOW THE STEPS DETAILED BELOW IN CASE YOU WANT TO RUN MD SIMULATIONS WITH THIS CODE.

# 1. Ensure that all .f90 files are in the same folder. In our case, these files are located in the /scr folder. The files are:

	- 0-MAIN_CODE.f90: The main program, handles input/output, initialization, and simulation execution.
	- 1-read_Natoms.f90: Reads the number of atoms from the input file.
	- 2-read_molecule.f90: Reads coordinates and masses of atoms.
	- 3-compute_distances.f90: Calculates distances between atoms.
	- 4-V.f90: Computes potential energy using the Lennard-Jones potential.
	- 5-kinetic_energy.f90: Calculates kinetic energy based on velocities.
	- 6-total_energy.f90: Computes total energy (kinetic + potential).
	- 7-compute_acc.f90: Calculates acceleration based on forces.
        - 8-mass2symbol.f90: Converts atomic masses read on input to the corresponding chemical symbol. 
	- 9-molecular_dynamics.f90: Contains the main simulation loop.

# 2.1 Compile the code with the following statement, in one line (the name of the program is up to you, that's why it is in parentheses, when writting on the terminal
# DO NOT write the paarenthesis):

	gfortran -o (MD.x) 0-MAIN_CODE.f90 1-read_Natoms.f90 2-read_molecule.f90 3-compute_distances.f90 4-V.f90 5-kinetic_energy.f90 
	6-total_energy.f90 7-compute_acc.f90 8-mass2symbol.f90 9-molecular_dynamics.f90	

# 2.2. Alternatively, you can use the following comand inside the /scr folder:

	gfortran -o (MD.x) *.f90

# 3. Copy the program you generated inside a folder where you have some input file:

	./(md_simulation)

# 4. Run the code in the folder you chose by writting this in the terminal:

	./(MD.x)


# 4. The prompt will ask you to enter the name of your input file. Do it, including the extension if it has one (for example: test1.inp).

# 5. You will get a file called trajectories.xyz. The trajectories.xyz file contains trajectory data recorded at every 10 steps. The simulation uses a tstep of 0.2 fs,
# so the total time of simulation is 200 fs. You can change it if you modify the source code and recompile the program.
 
# 6. Now you can read trajectories.xyz using, for example, vi. For more information about the output format, read the README file.
